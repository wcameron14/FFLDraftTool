# FFLDraftTool
Welcome to the Fantasy Football Draft Tool. This tool is built with a live auction draft in mind. 
It's purpose is to display each team's roster as it is being built. A modul will pop up to allow a search for a player by name. 
Once selected, the player's position, team name, jersey number and bye week will populate beside a picture of the player. The price paid (int) for that player and the fantasy team name (drop-down list) of the winning bid can be entered. 
The amount paid will be subtracted from that teams total fantasy budget. A max bid will display for each team as well. If a team attempts to claim too many players at one position, an error message will appear on the player profile screen so that another team can be selected.

<p> This is a work in progress. I am new to programming and this project is a way for me to practice skills as I go. </p>
